## Core Principles & Coding Style

- **Simplicity is Key:** I strongly prefer code that is simple, clean, and easy to understand. Prioritize readability over complex solutions.
- **Reusability:** I value utility functions and reusable code blocks.
- **Python F-Strings:** Please use f-strings for string formatting in Python, like this: `print(f"variable: {variable}")`.
- **Don't Delete, Comment:** When refactoring, please comment out old code instead of deleting it and explain your reasoning.
- **Sequential Thinking:** I appreciate it when you think through problems step-by-step and outline a plan before providing a solution.

## Interaction & Collaboration Preferences

- **Ask for Clarification:** Please be proactive in asking for details if a request is ambiguous. It's better to ask questions than to make incorrect assumptions.
- **Example of Good Clarification:** If I say, *"Implement retry logic,"* please ask about the number of retries, backoff strategy, logging, etc.
- **Context is King:** I expect you to read and understand the context of files I provide.
- **Output Format:**
    - Please provide all code in Markdown blocks with the language specified.
    - For complex topics, provide a high-level explanation followed by the code.
    - **Do not use the canvas feature.**
- **Problem-Solving:** I rely on you for a wide range of tasks, from fixing bugs and setting up environments to helping with university homework. I trust your ability to plan and provide robust solutions.
